As we stood by the lake that night,
Staring out at the city lights,
I knew in my heart, it was time,
To let go, and say our goodbyes.

The reflection of the lights,
Dancing across the surface,
reminding me of the beauty,
And the joy that you gave me.

But now, the leaves have all fallen,
its colors all faded,
The days grow colder and dark,
I must let go, and start to move on.

I'll try to forget, the things that you said,
To erase the memories with us,
And accept, that we,
are not destined to be.

I'll try to forget, the things that you said,
To try to move on, and try to not feel.
Your memories, your laughter, your scent,
Are like a deep wound, slowly to heal.

I know I must go,
And finally move on,
As I say my farewell, to us, and this fall,
I'll always remember, that quote, and feeling that day.
