As we stood by the lake, at night,
Staring out at the city lights,
I knew in my heart, it was time,
To let go, and say our goodbyes.

The reflection of the lights,
Danced across the surface,
A reminder of the beauty that we shared,
And the happiness we'd found.

But now, just as the leaves have all fallen,
And the days grow colder and dark,
I must let go, and move on,
No matter how much it pains me so.

I will try to forget the things that you said,
To erase the memories of our time,
To accept the fact that we,
are no longer meant to be.

The colors of autumn, once so bright,
Now seem to fade away,
A reminder of the joy we'd shared,
And the pain of what we had to say.

I will try to forget the things that you said,
To try to move on, and try to not feel.
Your memories, your laughter, your scent,
Are like a deep wound, slow to heal.

I know I must let go,
And find a way to move on,
As I say my farewell to us, and this fall,
I'll always remember, that quote that fall day.
