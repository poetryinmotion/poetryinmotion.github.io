As I sit in the back of the Uber,
I gaze out at the city at night,
The neon lights are shining bright,
Reflecting off the river's surface like a mirror.

The hustle and bustle of the day,
Has given way to a peaceful calm,
As the car glides along the roads,
I take in the beauty of the city, and its charms.

I see the towering skyscrapers,
Reaching up towards the stars,
A symphony of colors and light,
Dancing and twinkling in the dark.

The gentle flow of the river,
Adds to the serenity of the scene,
As it winds its way through the city,
A reminder of the natural world, and all that it has been.

I am grateful for this moment,
A chance to sit back, and breathe,
To take in the beauty of the city,
And to let go of all my cares, and just be.
