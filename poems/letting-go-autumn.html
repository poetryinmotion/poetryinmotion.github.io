As we stood by the lake, at night,
Staring out at the city lights,
I knew in my heart, it was time,
To let go of our love, and say our goodbyes.

The reflection of the lights,
Danced across the surface,
A reminder of the beauty we once shared,
And the happiness we'd found.

But now, just as the leaves have all fallen,
And the days grow colder and dark,
I must let you go, and move on,
Even though it pains me.

I will try to forget the things that you said,
To erase the memories of our time,
To accept the fact that we,
are no longer meant to be.

The colors of autumn, once so bright,
Now seem to fade away,
A reminder of the joy we'd shared,
And the pain of what we had to say.

I try to forget the things you once told me,
To move on and no longer feel,
But the memories linger,
Like a wound that won't heal.

I know that I must let go,
And find a way to move on,
As I say goodbye to us, and the fall,
I'll always remember that quote we shared that day.
