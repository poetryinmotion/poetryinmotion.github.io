As we stood by the lake at night,
Staring out at the city lights,
I knew in my heart, it was time,
To let go of our love, and say our goodbyes.

The reflection of the lights,
Danced across the surface,
A reminder of the beauty we once shared,
And the happiness that we'd found.

But now, just as the leaves have fallen,
And the days grow colder and darker,
I must let you go, and move on,
Even though it pains me.

I will try to forget the things you said,
To erase the memories of our time,
To accept the fact that our love,
Is no longer meant to be.

The colors of autumn, once so bright,
Now seem to fade away,
A reminder of the joy we'd shared,
And the pain of what we had to say.

I try to forget the things you told me,
To move on and leave you,
But the memories linger on,
Like a wound that won't heal.

I know that I must let go,
And find a way to move on,
As I say goodbye to us, and the fall,
I'll always remember that quote I once told you.
